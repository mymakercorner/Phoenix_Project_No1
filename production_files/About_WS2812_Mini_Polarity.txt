
This is specific polarity information to correctly place WS2812 mini leds onto the PCB.
Those leds are designed in the BOM as D1 to D16.

Please be aware that the triangle cutout of the WS2812 mini led is not indicating pin 1, but pin 3 of the chip.
The WS2812 mini footprint indicates pin 1 on the silkscreen with a dot, diametrically opposite of pin 3 indicated by the triangle cutout.
